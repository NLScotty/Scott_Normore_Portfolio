This is Scott Normore's Submission for Lab 2
------------------------------------
Part A
------------------------------------
I took some time to format the photo so it shrinks or grows with page size. I use in my css
negative values for marigins so that the dividers touch the ends of the page. I also added 
custom google fonts as recommended. I importhem straight from the site, so it will require
internet access. If not connected, I use a different font family anyways to highlight how it
changes using the @media print tag.

-----------------------------------
Part B
-----------------------------------
I have photos a subfolder of images because I felt it was appropiate, because not all images are photos, but photos are images.

I use a image for the back ground. I also use a google font using the same method as part A. 
I took some time to format the images so that they look good on most computer screens.
They will orient themselves 2 at a time unless it is too little space, then they will display one by one.
The image will shrink in width if the page is not wide enough. The caption of the image is always centered below the image.

In the revision, I added descriptions of the pictures along with the captions, as required.

Let me know if I missed anything, or any other tips you would recommended.
