This is Scott Normore's Submission for Lab One

Included in the partA folder are:
	-The HTML files: index.html, page2.html, and page3.html
	-A subdirectory with the included images
	-Some Documentation found within the index.html code
		The other files share most of the same code, so I felt
		documenting them would be redundant. Thoughts on this
		going foward would be appreciated!

Included in the partB folder are:
	-The HTML file index.html
	-Incuded documentation within the index.html file

Let me know what you think of the div containers in partA.
I feel like it would be useful for applying CSS to the page, 
but on the otherhand, I'm not sure if it is too much. Thoughts?
